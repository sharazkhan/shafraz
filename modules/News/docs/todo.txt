News TODO 10-Mar-09
Last update 17-Jan-2010

New/Modify interface:
- Adjust New(user/admin)/Modify views with a right column for publicationoptions, status, category and Preview/Publish/Schedule buttons. Sort of based on Wordpress interface
- DONE Remove Publish/Preview dropdownlist for a seperate Preview/Publish button. Eases Direct publishing one click less. 
- DONE Adjust publish button into Schedule when unlimited is not checked (make sure that ajax editing also works !)
- DONE Add Calendar (JSCalendar or Proto/script one) to the Date selection of From and To (needs change in the templates and processing of the datetime)
DONE - Remove seconds from Date seletion and make minutes in 5 minute interval. An admin setting might be a good idea: (only days, only hours, default 10mins, 5mins, mins).

Featuring Articles based upon attributes
SOLVED by weight article property. This can be used in various ways.
- Make a admin setting, use default FeatureStory attribute yes/no
- Extend the attributes for some default ones to be read only if no ADMIN rights are there
- Make a default FeatureStory attribute set to 0 if admin setting is on
- Make a FeatureStory block that uses the FeatureStory attribute to display them in a block, order ?

Admin interface:
- Add inline quick edit mode for title, publication options, status using ajax.
DONE - Make sure categories are taken into account for the [ all(#) | published (#) | ... ] links. This needs the news_{property}_category form to be independent of property
- Optional place the actions below the title in a hidden state and showing when you hover over that article (instead of on the right), discuss first with Mateo (see Wordpress)
- seperate setting of the number of articles to be shown in the admin interface

Article etc templates:
- DONE Add the dateformatHuman modifier to the dates there with a nicevalue of 3 (or 4), so only within one day (or specified days as admin setting) display human dates
- DONE Display all categories (so all cats in all cat properties like in news_user_index) with the article and article content.

dateformatHuman modifier:
- Extend the nicevalue with an additional value for Human readable dates with a specified nr of days, so up until nrOfDays ago display that otherwise format

Tickets:
DONE AND OK NOW - Test the autonews and queue update procedure for those 764 tables.
DONE - editing with ajax and scribite/shorturls etc to be solved. 

Removing/Cleanup Legacy stuff:
- DONE Change the permission sheme from Stories:: to News:: (the admin panel in zk111 uses the module name to check for permissions. Requires also an update of the already present permissions during the pninit upgrade.
- DONE Change the database name from zk_stories to zk_news and make a clear note forPendingContent users that use the dbase directly. Discuss first.
