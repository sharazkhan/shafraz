<p>The News module provides the ability to add, edit and delete news articles published in the News index page or displayed in various blocks.</p>
<p>News has a simple but efficient workflow. Articles submitted by users are assigned pending review status, and administrators then publish, hold, reject or archive the articles. Articles can be saved as Draft before submitting. Articles can also be published directly, or can be assigned a publication date that is in the future. These articles will not be visible until the publication date has arrived.</p>
<p>News works perfectly with Scribite, the Zikula WYSIWYG editor, which is an excellent tool for drafting articles, because it simplifies the addition of mark-up, inclusion of links, etc.</p>
